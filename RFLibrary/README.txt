The RF solution is intended to implement basic business flows for a supplier of Radio Frequency 
components (mostly antennas).

Antennas may have different kinds of setups or installations (i.e. to be Fixed or Mobiles), 
be active or passive (i.e. to have receiver and transmitter or only receiver) and support 
different frequency bands. Some of frequency bands for transmittng ones are licensed, 
so some additional data may be stored.

Partners and orders classes are developed, but no real business flow is attached yet.

Simple warehouse storage has been implemented which is basically a 10-elements queue at the moment. 

Most of classes have unit tests for every method in it.
